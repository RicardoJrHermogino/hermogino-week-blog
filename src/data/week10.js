    <h2>Starting the RHU System Development Journey</h2>
    <p>This week marked a crucial turning point—we officially kicked off the RHU system development. After careful consideration, we finalized the tech stack to ensure scalability and smooth performance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Next.js</strong> for frontend development, providing server-side rendering and seamless routing</li>
      <li><strong>Material UI</strong> for consistent and modern UI components</li>
      <li><strong>Next.js API Routes</strong> to handle backend operations efficiently</li>
      <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> as the database for flexible data management</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frontend Development Kickoff</h3>
    <p>With the stack locked in, I focused on starting the frontend structure. Key accomplishments included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up the basic project architecture using Next.js</li>
      <li>Implementing initial layout and navigation components</li>
      <li>Designing reusable UI components using Material UI</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Backend Foundation</h3>
    <p>While frontend work took center stage, I also laid down the groundwork for backend integration using Next.js API Routes. This involved setting up initial API endpoints and preparing database connection logic for MongoDB.</p>

    <h3>Balancing Dev with RHU Tasks</h3>
    <p>In between coding sessions, I continued assisting with RHU’s daily operations, particularly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient data into the ITR system</li>
      <li>Organizing and updating medical records alongside staff</li>
      <li>Supporting data entry for new patient visits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It was a week of shifting gears—switching from coding in the morning to real-world data management by afternoon. That hands-on exposure kept the development grounded in actual RHU workflows.</p>

    <h3>Last Week of Co-Interns & Christmas Party</h3>
    <p>This week was also bittersweet, it marked the final OJT week for most of our classmates. Since they had already completed their required hours, they were no longer around to join the Christmas party organized exclusively for our department, the Gubat Rural Health Unit and Birthing Home. Only Chryst Ian Ereve, Kenneth Fazon, and I were still active interns, so we were invited to celebrate with the staff. The party was lively, with plenty of delicious food, making it even more memorable for the few of us remaining.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>Next week’s focus will be on expanding frontend features and tightening backend connectivity, making sure both sides are ready to work in sync as development progresses.</p>
