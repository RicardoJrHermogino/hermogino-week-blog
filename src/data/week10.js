    <h2>Wrapping Up System Development</h2>
    <p>This week was all about pushing through the final stages of the RHU system development. I worked on polishing both the backend functionalities and frontend interfaces to ensure the system's key features were complete and user-friendly.</p>
    
    <h3>Backend and Frontend Progress</h3>
    <p>Specifically, I focused on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Finalizing CRUD operations for key patient and medical records</li>
      <li>Improving UI components to ensure smooth navigation and usability</li>
      <li>Testing newly added features and fixing minor bugs encountered along the way</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Balancing Development with RHU Tasks</h3>
    <p>While wrapping up the system, I also continued contributing to the RHU’s daily operations. Much of my time was spent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient data into the ITR system</li>
      <li>Assisting staff in organizing and updating medical records</li>
      <li>Helping with data entry for new patient visits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It was a balancing act—coding and debugging one moment, then assisting with records and encoding the next. But it gave me a better appreciation of the real-world application of the system we're building.</p>
    
    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>With most of the development work completed, we’re now preparing to shift focus fully on testing and deployment next week. The goal is to ensure the system is stable and ready for actual use by the RHU staff.</p>
