    <h2>Starting the RHU System Development Journey</h2>
    <p>This week marked a crucial turning point—we officially kicked off the RHU system development. After careful consideration, we finalized the tech stack to ensure scalability and smooth performance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Next.js</strong> for frontend development, providing server-side rendering and seamless routing</li>
      <li><strong>Material UI</strong> for consistent and modern UI components</li>
      <li><strong>Next.js API Routes</strong> to handle backend operations efficiently</li>
      <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> as the database for flexible data management</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frontend Development Kickoff</h3>
    <p>With the stack locked in, I focused on starting the frontend structure. Key accomplishments included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up the basic project architecture using Next.js</li>
      <li>Implementing initial layout and navigation components</li>
      <li>Designing reusable UI components using Material UI</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Backend Foundation</h3>
    <p>While frontend work took center stage, I also laid down the groundwork for backend integration using Next.js API Routes. This involved setting up initial API endpoints and preparing database connection logic for MongoDB.</p>

    <h3>Balancing Dev with RHU Tasks</h3>
    <p>In between coding sessions, I continued assisting with RHU’s daily operations, particularly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient data into the ITR system</li>
      <li>Organizing and updating medical records alongside staff</li>
      <li>Supporting data entry for new patient visits</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It was a week of shifting gears—switching from coding in the morning to real-world data management by afternoon. That hands-on exposure kept the development grounded in actual RHU workflows.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>Next week’s focus will be on expanding frontend features and tightening backend connectivity, making sure both sides are ready to work in sync as development progresses.</p>
