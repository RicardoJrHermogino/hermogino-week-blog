    <h2>Getting Comfortable with the Workflow</h2>
    <p>By the fourth week, I felt myself settling into the rhythm of daily tasks at Gubat RHU. The familiar cycle of encoding, organizing, and assisting with clerical duties became smoother with each passing day.</p>

    <h3>Regular Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>This week focused mainly on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient information accurately into the iClinicSys system</li>
      <li>Sorting and filing patient records based on their codes and dates</li>
      <li>Checking PhilHealth eligibility when needed</li>
      <li>Assisting the RHU staff in their routine administrative tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Improved Confidence & Speed</h3>
    <p>One highlight for me was how much quicker and more confident I became in reading and interpreting doctors' handwriting, especially on prescriptions and medical diagnoses. Early on, I used to pause frequently to double-check. Now, I’m able to process and encode information without hesitation.</p>

    <h3>Supporting the Team</h3>
    <p>I also noticed how my growing familiarity with the system allowed me to assist the staff more effectively. Whether it was helping sort through files or providing quick data lookups, I felt like a more reliable member of the team.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>As I continue, I aim to further improve my speed and precision, while also learning more about the inner workings of RHU operations.</p>
