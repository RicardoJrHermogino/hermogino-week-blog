      <h2>Hands-On Training with IClinicSys</h2>
      <p>This week marked the beginning of my On-the-Job Training (OJT) at Gubat Rural Health Unit (RHU), where I got a firsthand look at the fast-paced operations of a healthcare facility’s IT system. On my first day, Kuya Jay-Ar Jarabejo, one of the IT staff, personally welcomed me and oriented me with the workflow. Dr. Ronald E. Ferreras, the Municipal Health Officer of Gubat, wasn’t available during my first day due to his busy schedule, but in the following days, I had the chance to meet him briefly as he made time despite the continuous flow of patients and responsibilities. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with my classmates assigned to the same facility, making it easier to adjust to the RHU’s dynamic environment.</p>

      <p>By my third day, I dove straight into something crucial—digitizing patient data. Kuya Jay-Ar personally trained me on how to accurately encode information from numerous paper records into the IClinicSys system. One of the key lessons I learned was how to navigate and utilize this Integrated Clinic Information System, an essential tool in managing patient records and clinical data. My classmates also helped me understand various functions of the platform, making the learning process more manageable.</p>

      <p>It quickly dawned on me how essential speed and efficiency are when handling patient data, especially in a facility like Gubat RHU and Birthing Home. Since they offer free consultations and services—ranging from medical check-ups, PhilHealth processing, and more—the lines of patients grow long every single day. Because the services are free, there’s always a steady stream of patients waiting to be attended to, and the doctors and nurses are constantly moving fast to accommodate everyone. It became clear to me that being quick and precise in encoding is vital, so healthcare workers can focus on providing immediate care without unnecessary delays.</p>

      <h3>Training Highlights</h3>
      <p>During the training session, I learned how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigate and utilize the IClinicSys platform effectively</li>
        <li>Understand patient forms and properly interpret handwritten data</li>
        <li>Input patient demographics, medical history, and consultation details correctly</li>
        <li>Ensure data accuracy and maintain confidentiality at all times</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
      <p>One of the initial challenges I encountered was ensuring data accuracy, especially when deciphering some of the handwritten records—some entries were tricky. In particular, reading the doctors’ handwriting on prescriptions, consultation notes, patient diagnoses, and other important details proved to be a real challenge. The penmanship varied a lot, making it difficult to interpret the exact information. Thankfully, Kuya Jay-Ar and Ate Rona were always ready to assist, helping me read and understand the handwritten information on the paper records. Kuya Jay-Ar also gave me practical tips on double-checking entries and cross-referencing key details to avoid errors. Adapting to the fast-paced workflow of the health unit was another hurdle, but with their guidance and the support of my classmates, I gradually became more confident and efficient in handling tasks.</p>

      <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
      <p>By the end of the week, I became more confident in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using IClinicSys efficiently for patient data management</li>
        <li>Maintaining data integrity while handling sensitive information</li>
        <li>Following proper data privacy protocols</li>
        <li>Working faster without compromising accuracy</li>
        <li>Strengthening my teamwork and communication skills</li>
      </ul>
