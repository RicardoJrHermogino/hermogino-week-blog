    <h2>Welcoming Chryst Ian & Maintaining the Pace</h2>
    <p>This week brought a new dynamic as Chryst Ian joined our internship team at Gubat RHU. Having already built confidence over the past weeks, I stepped up to help him get familiar with the RHU's workflow, from patient encoding to navigating iClinicSys and PhilHealth systems.</p>
    
    <p>At the same time, I continued to handle my regular tasks efficiently—whether it was encoding patient records, organizing files, or supporting staff during daily operations. Balancing the role of mentor while keeping up with duties proved to be both a rewarding and reflective experience.</p>

    <h3>Strengthening Skills Through Mentorship</h3>
    <p>Guiding Ian wasn’t just about explaining tasks—it was also a chance for me to solidify my own understanding. Teaching pushed me to communicate clearly, troubleshoot questions, and stay patient, all while maintaining smooth operations. It felt good realizing how much ground I'd covered since starting.</p>

    <h3>Teamwork & Growth</h3>
    <p>The week highlighted the value of teamwork and adaptability. Working together with my classmates and the RHU staff, while assisting Ian, showcased how collaboration makes the workflow efficient—even when new challenges come in.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>Heading into the final week, I’m motivated to finish strong, ensuring that not only my contributions, but also the guidance I’ve offered, leave a lasting impact.</p>
