    <h2>Wrapping Up Development Amid Daily RHU Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Our eleventh week was a delicate balancing act. While assisting the RHU staff with their usual daily tasks—whether encoding records, accommodating patients, or organizing files—we were also focused on finalizing the RHU system we've been developing over the past weeks.</p>
    
    <h3>Finalizing Features</h3>
    <p>At the start of the week, we concentrated on polishing the remaining features of the system. All core functionalities were already in place, so our priority was refining the user interface and ensuring all modules operated seamlessly.</p>
    
    <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <p>By midweek, our attention shifted to rigorous testing and debugging. We made sure every feature, both in the backend and frontend, performed as expected. Any minor bugs or performance concerns were promptly addressed.</p>
    
    <h3>Balancing RHU Tasks</h3>
    <p>While working on the system, we also continued to support the RHU's daily workflow. This experience tested our time management skills as we handled tasks like patient registration, data encoding, and other administrative duties alongside system development.</p>
    
    <h3>System Completion</h3>
    <p>By the end of the week, with all tests passed and RHU responsibilities fulfilled, we confidently declared the system development phase complete. Seeing the project come together while still contributing to the RHU’s day-to-day operations made the achievement even more rewarding.</p>

    <h3>LGU Gubat Christmas Party at Encinas Pavilion</h3>
    <p>Another highlight of this week was the grand Christmas party hosted for all departments under LGU Gubat. Held at Encinas Pavilion, Gubat Municipal Hall, the celebration was festive and lively, filled with entertaining shows and an abundance of delicious food. I was seated at a table alongside a few of the RHU midwives, nurses, IT personnel, and staff. Sharing laughs and stories with them outside the usual work environment felt heartwarming—it made me realize how tightly-knit and supportive the RHU community is.</p>
    
    <p>What made the event even more special was how welcoming everyone was—it truly felt like we were part of the LGU Gubat family, not just interns. Experiencing firsthand how employees gather, celebrate, and enjoy moments like this gave me a clearer glimpse of real-life workplace culture. It made me realize how camaraderie and shared celebrations play an essential role in professional life.</p>
