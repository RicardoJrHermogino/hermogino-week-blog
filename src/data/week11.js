    <h2>Finalizing Development</h2>
    <p>At the start of our eleventh week, we focused on finishing the remaining features and polishing the RHU system. After weeks of consistent effort, the core functionalities were all in place, and the system was ready for final checks.</p>
    
    <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
    <p>By mid to late week, our focus shifted entirely to testing and debugging. We carefully tested each feature, ensuring both backend processes and user interfaces were working as intended. No critical issues or bugs were found during this phase.</p>
    
    <h3>System Completion</h3>
    <p>With all tests passed and the system running smoothly, we declared the development phase officially complete by the end of the week. We prepared for system turnover and documentation for the RHU staff.</p>
    
    <p>Seeing the system fully functional and ready for use was a rewarding milestone, marking the near end of our OJT journey.</p>
