    <h2>Ongoing RHU Support & New Web Development Assignment</h2>
    <p>This week, I continued to assist with the regular duties at Gubat RHU—primarily focusing on patient data encoding, record management, and ensuring that all files remained up-to-date within the iClinicSys platform.</p>
    
    <h3>RHU Website Project Kickoff</h3>
    <p>In addition to the routine administrative work, Dr. Ronald approached our team with an exciting new task: to design and develop an official RHU website. The goal is to create a user-friendly platform that will showcase the RHU’s services, upcoming events, health announcements, and provide admin access for easier content management.</p>
    
    <p>We began gathering the necessary requirements, brainstorming features, and drafting an initial plan. Full development is scheduled to start next week.</p>

    <h3>Key Features Discussed:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Events and announcements section for RHU programs</li>
      <li>Admin panel for easy content updates</li>
      <li>Patient information and services overview</li>
      <li>Responsive design for both desktop and mobile users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This week balanced routine tasks with the anticipation of something new. While encoding has become second nature, the website assignment adds an exciting development challenge. I'm looking forward to applying my technical skills to benefit the RHU’s operations and visibility.</p>
