    <h2>Getting Comfortable with RHU Workflow</h2>
    <p>My second week at Gubat RHU was all about finding my rhythm. The environment was fast-paced but welcoming, and I started adjusting well to the daily tasks assigned to us interns.</p>

    <h3>Improving Efficiency in Regular Tasks</h3>
    <p>I steadily improved in performing key responsibilities like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient data accurately into the iClinicSys system</li>
      <li>Conducting PhilHealth eligibility checks smoothly</li>
      <li>Organizing patient records and documents efficiently</li>
      <li>Assisting the staff in daily operations and administrative work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Positive Environment & Supportive Staff</h3>
    <p>One thing I noticed this week was how genuinely supportive the RHU staff are. The doctors, nurses, and admin personnel were approachable and kind, always ready to lend a hand or offer advice when needed. This made adjusting to the workflow much easier and enjoyable.</p>

    <h3>Learning Curve & Growth</h3>
    <p>Although I encountered a few hiccups when handling certain forms or patient cases, I was able to quickly learn from the staff and correct any mistakes. Each day, I noticed myself becoming faster and more confident with the encoding process.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>Next week, I aim to refine my familiarity with different RHU documents and hopefully master reading doctors' handwriting, which I noticed is key to being even more efficient.</p>
