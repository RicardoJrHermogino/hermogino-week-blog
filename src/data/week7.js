    <h2>PhilHealth Konsulta Event Participation</h2>
    <p>This week, my classmates and I were assigned as part of the official workforce for the <strong>PhilHealth Konsulta</strong> event held at the Encinas Pavilion Gubat, Sorsogon. The program aimed to provide free medical check-ups and consultations to community members, with our team specifically tasked to manage the registration process and data encoding responsibilities.</p>
    
    <h3>Assigned Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>We played a key role in ensuring the smooth flow of the event by taking charge of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitating the registration process for attendees</li>
      <li>Encoding accurate patient information into the PhilHealth system</li>
      <li>Verifying PhilHealth membership and eligibility details</li>
      <li>Coordinating with healthcare personnel to guide patients through each step</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Skills and Insights Gained</h3>
    <p>Being part of the event operations team allowed me to sharpen my skills in data management, organizational efficiency, and clear communication. Working in a live, public health setting taught me how crucial accuracy and professionalism are, especially when handling sensitive personal information.</p>
    
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Contributing to the PhilHealth Konsulta event as an assigned member of the workforce was both a rewarding and eye-opening experience. It was fulfilling to be directly involved in a program that supports public health access, and it gave me valuable exposure to real-world operational workflows. This experience strengthened my sense of responsibility and highlighted the importance of precision and service in any community-centered initiative.</p>
