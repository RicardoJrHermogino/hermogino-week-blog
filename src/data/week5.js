    <h2>Mastering the Flow</h2>
    <p>Week five felt like hitting my stride. The daily operations at Gubat RHU, which once felt like a mountain of forms and codes, now flowed naturally. Encoding, sorting, assisting—it all became second nature.</p>

    <h3>Seamless Task Execution</h3>
    <p>I confidently handled tasks such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient information quickly and accurately</li>
      <li>Organizing and filing medical records without needing constant checks</li>
      <li>Processing PhilHealth eligibility and patient records without supervisor input</li>
      <li>Assisting with document preparation and day-to-day clerical tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem-Solving Independence</h3>
    <p>What stood out this week was how I started handling uncommon cases—whether it was a missing patient code, unclear document, or system hiccup—on my own. Rarely did I need to pause and ask for guidance; I was able to troubleshoot, fix, and keep things moving smoothly.</p>

    <h3>Supporting the RHU Team</h3>
    <p>With this confidence, I found myself proactively helping the RHU staff whenever they needed an extra hand—whether reorganizing records, encoding bulk data faster, or answering quick questions about files.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>For the final week, I'm aiming to keep this momentum going strong. I want to leave the RHU knowing I’ve contributed effectively, while also being ready to carry these skills forward beyond my internship.</p>
