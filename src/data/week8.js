    <h2>Finalizing Patient Records & Handling PhilHealth Claims</h2>
    <p>As the internship neared its close, I focused on refining my efficiency in encoding patient records through iClinicSys. My tasks this week involved not just data entry, but also ensuring that all information aligned with RHU’s standards and protocols.</p>
    
    <h3>PhilHealth Eligibility Verification</h3>
    <p>A major responsibility this week was processing PhilHealth eligibility claims. I carefully reviewed Individual Treatment Records (ITRs) and checked each patient’s registration status under Gubat RHU. Verifying these records was crucial in making sure patients' PhilHealth claims were valid and properly documented.</p>

    <h3>Mastery of RHU Systems</h3>
    <p>With several weeks of experience behind me, navigating iClinicSys and PhilHealth systems felt second nature. I handled record encoding tasks confidently and efficiently, ensuring accuracy and consistency throughout the process.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This final week solidified all the skills I’ve built throughout the internship—attention to detail, system navigation, and responsibility over sensitive patient data. Looking back, I feel accomplished seeing how much I’ve grown in handling real-world administrative and healthcare workflows.</p>
