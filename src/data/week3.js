    <h2>Focusing on Record Organization</h2>
    <p>The third week at Gubat RHU was a bit more relaxed compared to previous weeks. There were fewer tasks lined up, giving us some breathing room to catch up on non-urgent assignments.</p>

    <h3>Assigned Record Filing</h3>
    <p>Sir Jay Ar tasked me and my classmate Kenneth Fazon to focus on organizing paper records. Specifically, we sorted and filed documents based on their codes and numbers, making sure everything was properly arranged for easy retrieval.</p>

    <h3>Back to Encoding</h3>
    <p>After completing the filing tasks, we returned to our usual responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient data into iClinicSys</li>
      <li>Checking PhilHealth eligibility when needed</li>
      <li>Assisting staff in day-to-day clerical work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Efficiency Boost</h3>
    <p>The lighter workload this week allowed me to focus more on accuracy and speed, both in record organization and encoding. It also gave me a chance to further refine my familiarity with the different codes and filing system used by the RHU.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>Next week, I'm expecting to take on more regular tasks again, further honing my skills in encoding and patient record management.</p>
