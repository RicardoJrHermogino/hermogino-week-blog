      <h2>Frontend Development Journey</h2>
      <p>My third week shifted focus to the frontend. After building the backend endpoints last week, I was eager to create user interfaces that would consume these APIs and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
      
      <h3>React Fundamentals</h3>
      <p>I dedicated time to learning React's core concepts, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Component-based architecture</li>
        <li>JSX syntax and expressions</li>
        <li>State and props management</li>
        <li>Lifecycle methods and hooks</li>
        <li>Conditional rendering techniques</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Material UI Implementation</h3>
      <p>The team uses Material UI for consistent design across the application. I learned how to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up theming and customize components</li>
        <li>Use the grid system for responsive layouts</li>
        <li>Implement form controls and validation</li>
        <li>Create dialog boxes and modals</li>
        <li>Use transitions and animations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Building My First Component</h3>
      <p>I created a data table component that displayed information from one of the API endpoints I built last week. This involved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting up API service with Axios</li>
        <li>Implementing data fetching with useEffect</li>
        <li>Creating loading and error states</li>
        <li>Adding sorting and filtering functionality</li>
        <li>Implementing pagination</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Collaborative Development</h3>
      <p>I paired with a senior frontend developer to optimize my component. This collaboration helped me understand performance considerations and advanced React patterns.</p>
      
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>Next week, I'll be diving into authentication systems to secure our application. I'm excited to learn about JWT tokens and implementing protected routes.</p>
