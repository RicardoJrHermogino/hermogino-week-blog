    <h2>Focusing on Record Organization</h2>
    <p>The third week at Gubat RHU was relatively lighter than the past weeks. Fewer tasks meant we had time to clear out backlog and focus on non-urgent assignments.</p>

    <h3>Assigned Record Filing</h3>
    <p>Sir Jay Ar tasked me and my classmate Kenneth Fazon to organize and file paper records systematically. We sorted documents according to their codes and numbers, ensuring they were properly arranged for quick access when needed.</p>

    <h3>Back to Encoding</h3>
    <p>Once we finished filing, we shifted back to our usual roles, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encoding patient data into iClinicSys</li>
      <li>Checking PhilHealth eligibility when necessary</li>
      <li>Assisting RHU staff with their day-to-day clerical tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unexpected Tech Duty</h3>
    <p>In between the lighter workload, I also had a chance to observe Ma'am Rona, one of the IT staff, as she diagnosed a PC issue. The desktop wasn’t powering on, and after a quick check, she found that the Power Supply Unit (PSU) had failed. Surprisingly, Ma'am Rona let me assist her—she guided me to carefully detach the faulty PSU and install the replacement unit, reconnecting all necessary cables myself. It was a valuable hands-on experience, stepping a bit outside of the usual encoding tasks.</p>

    <h3>Efficiency Boost</h3>
    <p>With fewer immediate tasks, I was able to focus more on improving accuracy and speed in both filing and encoding. It also gave me extra time to better familiarize myself with RHU's filing systems and technical workflows.</p>

    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    <p>As the workload is expected to pick up again next week, I’m looking forward to applying both my improved clerical skills and the unexpected technical knowledge I gained.</p>
